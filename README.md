# Obesity_Prediction_using_ML 

The Obesity Prediction using Machine Learning project aims to predict an individual's obesity risk level based on their physical attributes and behavioral habits such as eating patterns, physical activity, and lifestyle factors. The project leverages a data-driven approach to support early health awareness and preventive care.

A Logistic Regression model was developed using Scikit-learn, following a structured machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables with OrdinalEncoder, and feature scaling using StandardScaler. The model achieved 91% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating high reliability in classification performance.

The trained model was integrated into an interactive web application built on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing users to input their data and receive real-time obesity risk predictions. The environment and dependencies were carefully managed to ensure reproducibility, easy deployment, and smooth user interaction.
